# Homebrew Calculator

This repository contains a single static webpage that calculates ingredient amounts for brewing steroid solutions. The logic and styles are all in `Index.html` (HTML, CSS and JavaScript).

## Running locally

1. Make sure `Index.html` is present.
2. Open the file with any modern web browser or host it with a simple static server, e.g. `python3 -m http.server`.

The page uses only builtâ€‘in browser features, so no additional dependencies are required.
